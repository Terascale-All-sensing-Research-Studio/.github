At the [Terascale All-sensing Research Studio (TARS)](https://tars.clarkson.edu/) at Clarkson University, we perform research in human-driven artificial intelligence using capture and analysis of dense multi-person interactions in online and real-world environments. The core of our work is in understanding how humans perform tasks in the real-world, to inform next generation artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and virtual reality. Our research spans computer vision, deep learning, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction.
