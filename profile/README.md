At the [Terascale All-sensing Research Studio (TARS)](https://tars-home.github.io/) at Wright State University, Dayton, OH, we perform research in human-driven artificial intelligence using capture and analysis of dense multi-person interactions in online and real-world environments. Our research spans computer vision, computer graphics, deep learning, human-robot interaction, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
