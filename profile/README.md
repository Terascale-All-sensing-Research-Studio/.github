The [Terascale All-sensing Research Studio (TARS)](https://tars.clarkson.edu/) is an interdisciplinary laboratory at Clarkson University that conducts research on human-driven artificial intelligence in online and real-world environments. The core of the work is to understand how humans perform real-world tasks to inform next-generation artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and virtual reality, with research spanning computer vision, deep learning, computer graphics, and human-computer interaction.
